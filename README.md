Stock market forecasting is a challenging and important task for investors and financial analysts.

Approaches used were: Weighted Moving Average (WMA),Exponential Smoothing (ES), Autoregressive Integrated MovingAverage (ARIMA), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers, and Neural Networks through LSTM.
 We conduct experiments using historical stock market data and evaluate the performance of each algorithm based on various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). The datasets used in the experiments include a diverse set of stocks from different sectors to ensure a comprehensive analysis.
